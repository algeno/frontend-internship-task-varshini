# Frontend Developer Task: User Card Application

## Overview
Your task is to create a single-page application that displays a list of user profiles. You'll be provided with a JSON data file containing fake user information. The application should present each user as a distinct card.

This is a practical coding challenge designed to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. We expect this task to take no more than 3-4 hours to complete. Please do not spend more time on this task. We are primarily interested in your approach, code quality, and how you solve a real-world problem, not how long you can spend on a perfect solution.

## Tech Stack

Our primary tech stack for this role is React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. We highly encourage you to use these technologies for this task as it will give us the best insight into how you approach development within our environment. However, you are free to use other libraries or frameworks for styling if you prefer.

## Task Requirements

1. __Data__: You are given a `users.json` file that is included in the repository. Your application should use this data to render the user cards.

2. __User Card View__: Display each user from the data as a separate card. The card for each user must include at least the following information:
   - Name
   - Age
   - Favorite Food

3. __Creative Freedom__: The provided user data contains additional fields. You are encouraged to be creative and include other information from the dataset to make the user cards more engaging and visually appealing. Any filtering and sorting functionality of the cards that feels natural can also be included.

3. __Styling__: We prefer you use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui to style the cards and the overall page layout. But you are free to use other libraries or frameworks for styling if you prefer. Ensure the design is clean, professional, and responsive.

4. __Readme__: Include a `README.md` file in the repository. The `README.md` file must contain clear, concise instructions on how to set up and run the application. This should include details on any dependencies (e.g., `npm install`) and the command to start the development server (e.g., `npm run dev`).

5. __Submission__: Push your final solution to this GitHub repository.


## Evaluation Criteria
We will evaluate your submission based on the following:
- __Code Quality__: Readability, organization, and adherence to best practices.
- __Implementation__: Correctly displaying the required data.
- __Creativity, Design, & Styling__: Visually appealing and responsive interface. How you incorporate additional data to create a compelling and unique user experience.
- __Instructions__: The clarity and accuracy of your `README.md` file.
